    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) come in different versions, with **standard** and **instruction-tuned (Instruct)** versions being the most common. Here’s a brief comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Purpose and Training**:\n",
    "   - **Standard LLM**: The standard model is generally pre-trained on large datasets without specific instruction-following capabilities. Typically generates more open-ended responses, which can be useful for creative writing or general information retrieval where the response style is flexible.\n",
    "   - **Instruct LLM**: Instruction-tuned models, like the **Llama-3.2 Instruct**, are fine-tuned on datasets designed to help the model understand and follow instructions effectively. This tuning enhances the model's ability to respond directly to user prompts and handle structured requests. It is fine-tuned to produce concise, direct responses that are often more relevant in task-specific or conversational AI applications.\n",

    "### **Evaluation of the Tokenizer Chat Template**\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the chat template of `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` is much more complex than the example above. It includes various components that help the model understand the context of the conversation, manage dates, handle tools, and structure messages effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The template is written in [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/templates/), a language that allows for the dynamic generation of content based on variables, conditions and loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's print it and analyze its key components:\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Components of the Template**:\n",
    "1. **System Message Extraction**:\n",
    "   - The system message is extracted if the first role in the message list is labeled \"system.\" This allows the template to clearly differentiate between user queries and system instructions.\n",
    "   - If a system message exists, it is added to the template between special tokens (`<|start_header_id|>` and `<|end_header_id|>`), ensuring that the model knows when the system message starts and ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Date Management**:\n",
    "   - The template automatically handles the current date using either a provided `strftime_now` function or a default date (`\"26 Jul 2024\"`). This can be useful when the model needs to be aware of the date in contexts such as time-sensitive responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Tools**:\n",
    "   - The template checks if **tools** are defined. If tools are available, it includes a description of these tools in the system message or the user message, depending on where they need to appear.\n",
    "   - If the tools are part of the user message, the template ensures that the first user message prompts the user to respond in a structured format, such as using JSON for function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Message Processing**:\n",
    "   - The template loops through the list of messages and processes each based on the role (`user`, `assistant`, `ipython`, or `tool`). It formats each message using start and end tokens for the roles, helping the model understand the structure of the conversation.\n",
    "   - If the message involves tool calls, the template ensures that they are properly formatted into a structured JSON format to be passed back to the model for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ending the Assistant's Response**:\n",
    "   - The template leaves a placeholder for the assistant’s response, which the model will generate during inference. This ensures that the assistant's response begins in the correct format, ready to be populated with the generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Is This Template Needed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintains Consistency**: This template ensures that the conversation is structured in a consistent manner, which is crucial for models designed to follow complex instructions or engage in multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "- **Handles Tools**: By incorporating the ability to dynamically introduce tools and functionality, the template allows the model to expand beyond simple text-based conversations and perform function-based tasks.\n",
    "- **Structured Outputs for Tools**: When the conversation involves tool calls (e.g., through APIs or function calls), the template ensures that these interactions are formatted properly for execution."
