# Large Language Models - Portfolio

This repository contains my personal work and implementations related to Large Language Models, originally based on the coursework from the *Large Language Models* course at Politecnico di Torino. I've extended and completed the laboratories independently to build a comprehensive understanding of LLM foundations and applications.

## About This Project

This collection represents my journey through the fundamental concepts and practical applications of Large Language Models. Each lab builds upon previous knowledge, progressing from basic deep learning concepts to advanced LLM applications in software engineering contexts.


## Part I - Foundations of Large Language Models

This section covers the fundamental concepts and architectures underlying modern LLMs:

- **Lab 01**: Introduction to deep learning with PyTorch - Building neural networks from scratch
- **Lab 02**: Transformers and HuggingFace ecosystem - Implementing T5 models and attention mechanisms
- **Lab 03**: Encoder-Decoder architectures - Deep dive into BERT and GPT models
- **Lab 04**: Causal Language Modeling - Understanding and implementing LLM training
- **Lab 05**: Efficient fine-tuning and inference - Quantization and LoRA techniques

## Part II - LLM Applications in Software Engineering

This section explores practical applications of LLMs in software development contexts:

- **Lab 06**: Prompt Engineering and RAG - Building retrieval-augmented generation systems
- **Lab 07**: User Stories and Chain Architectures - LLM-powered requirement engineering
- **Lab 08**: ROC evaluations and Router Agents - Performance evaluation and routing systems
- **Lab 09**: Code Generation - Automated programming with LLMs
- **Lab 10**: Test Generation - AI-powered testing strategies

## Key Technologies & Frameworks

- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **HuggingFace Transformers** - Pre-trained model library
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - Interactive development environment
- **Quantization & LoRA** - Model optimization techniques
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - Knowledge integration
